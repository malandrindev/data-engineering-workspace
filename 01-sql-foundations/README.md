# SQL for Data Engineering

This module documents core SQL patterns commonly used in
analytical workloads, data pipelines, and performance-sensitive queries.

Rather than focusing on syntax alone, the emphasis is on understanding
query behavior, trade-offs, and design decisions relevant to Data Engineering.

---

## Topics Covered

- JOIN strategies and data grain considerations
- Subqueries vs. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions for analytical queries
- Aggregations without loss of row-level detail
- Basic performance considerations and query readability

---

## Goal

Establish a solid and explicit understanding of SQL patterns that scale
from exploratory analysis to production-grade data pipelines.

---

## Scope

This module uses a small synthetic schema designed to isolate and demonstrate
core SQL concepts with full control over data volume, relationships,
and query execution behavior.
